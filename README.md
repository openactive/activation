## Activation Issue Tracker for OpenActive Implementations

We encourage you to make use of the issues on this repo when implementing the [OpenActive RPDE specification](https://www.openactive.io/realtime-paged-data-exchange/). 

### Quick Links

- [OpenActive RPDE specification](https://github.com/openactive/realtime-paged-data-exchange/blob/master/README.md) - the spec.
- [OpenActive: The Steps](https://www.openactive.io/technology.html#the-steps) - what to do after you've implemented the spec.

#### Your Implementation

For new implementations, please create an issue on this respository with an example JSON response (even if hypothetical, before work has begun), including a link to your test environment if appropriate, with the "example" label, for the community to comment on. Please do check the [implementation check list](https://github.com/openactive/realtime-paged-data-exchange/blob/master/README.md) before posting.

#### Issue Tracker Labels to Use

- *example*: For new implementations, please post an example JSON response (even if hypothetical, before work has begun) with a link to your test environment if appropriate, with the "example" label, for the community to comment on. We will then create a milestone associated with your implementation and raise any issues against that.
- *question*: For any questions about implementation in general, please raise an issue with a "question" label.
- *bug*: Issues that the community spot with a particular implementation are raised as bugs against the milestone related to that implementation.
- *enhancement*: Requests for additional data from a particular data source are made via "enhancements" against the milestone related to that implementation.
- *help wanted*: For help required from the community, please detail the request.
